This Code book presents the main information related with the variables used to develop the course project corresponding to “Getting and Cleaning Data” let by Jeef Leek at John Hopkins University using Coursera Platform.
The original information is based on previous work developed by Reyes-Ortiz et al (IWAAL 2012) and modified herein according to the professor’s instructions. 
Briefly, data were originated from an experiment carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, where the 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity was capture. The dataset was partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.
The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 
Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 
The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 
These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
* tBodyAcc-XYZ
* tGravityAcc-XYZ
* tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
* tBodyGyro-XYZ
* tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
* tBodyAccMag
* tGravityAccMag
* tBodyAccJerkMag
* tBodyGyroMag
* tBodyGyroJerkMag
* fBodyAcc-XYZ
* fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
* fBodyGyro-XYZ
* fBodyAccMag
* fBodyAccJerkMag
* fBodyGyroMag
* fBodyGyroJerkMag
The set of variables that were estimated (and kept for this assignment) from these signals are: 
* mean(): Mean value
* std(): Standard deviation
Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:
* gravityMean
* tBodyAccMean
* tBodyAccJerkMean
* tBodyGyroMean
* tBodyGyroJerkMean
Note: features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
As follows the procedure used to perform this assignment:
1. Download and unzip files
2. Read tables and label columns with appropriate names for test and train sets. Also select only the columns with the “mean” and “std” calculations.
3. Merge the data sets
4. Edit Activity column with corresponding activity types and coerce Subject as factor
5. Make a new data frame with the mean value of each activity-subject interaction, eliminate from the same data set the values corresponding to activity and subject.
6. Write tidy data set in a new file
